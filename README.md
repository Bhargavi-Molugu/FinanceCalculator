# FinanceCalculator
Program that allows the user to access two different Financial Calculators: An Investment Calculator and a Home Loan Repayment Calculator

● Import Math Module

● The Code follows :

The user is allowed to choose which calculation they want to do(either Investment or Home Loan Repayment).
 How the user capitalises their selection should not affect how the program proceeds. i.e. ‘Bond’, ‘bond’, ‘BOND’ or ‘investment’, ‘Investment’, ‘INVESTMENT’, etc. should all be recognised as valid entries.Any typed input is changed to Uppercase(can change to uppercase or lowercase) to get into the selected code calculation. If the user doesn’t type in a valid input, show an appropriate error message.

● If the user chooses ‘investment’, do the following:
● Ask the user to input:

  The amount of money that they are depositing.

  The interest rate (as a percentage). Only the number of the interest rate should be entered — don’t worry about having to deal with the added ‘%’, e.g. The user should enter 8 and not 8%.

  The number of years they plan on investing for.

  Then ask the user to input whether they want 'simple' or 'compound' interest, and store this in a variable called interest. Depending on they typed 'simple' or 'compound', output the appropriate amount that they will get back after the given period of time at the specific interest rate using Interest formula.
● If the user chooses 'bond', do the following: 
● Ask the user to input:
  The present value of the house.
  The interest rate. e.g: 7
  The number of months they plan to retake to repay the bond. e.g:120
  The amount that a person will have to be repaid on a homeloan each month is calculated using Repayment formula and output the amount
